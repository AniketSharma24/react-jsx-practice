# react-jsx-practice

This repository is a practice exercise in which I have created elements and functional components using JSX. The main purpose of this repository is to get familiar with JSX and understand how it compiles in the background. I have also covered the role of Babel, different ways to use components/elements in another component, and component composition.

## Do you know?

- JSX in background uses React.createElement. Browser doesn't understands JSX so Babel read our JSX code and converts it so that browser can understand.
- Babel works as a pipeline where we input our JSX code and it outputs browser friendly code
- Different ways of compoenent composition: 
  - `<Header />` - Traditional way
  - {Header()} - Atlast functional compoent is a JS function only
  - {title} - To use elements we can just write the name if the variable we have used to define the react element
